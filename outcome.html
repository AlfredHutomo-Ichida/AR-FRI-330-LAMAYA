            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>

            <p class="p1">
                As we all know, covid-19 suddenly appeared in the beginning of 2020. Because of its strong infectious, covid-19 has attracted people's attention and prevention. In recent months, the number of infections in Australia has been increasing rapidly, and some countries in the world are still indifferent to the virus. <br><br>

                After watching a lot of news reports, we think the real reason for the surge in infection cases in these countries is the different policies. Different from China, western countries generally implement the separation of powers, which leads to low efficiency. In addition, the central government and local governments act independently. In the face of the sudden epidemic, they lack strong and unified leadership, which leads to the serious lack of executive power of the government. Western countries are generally large society and small government, the ability of government to mobilize social resources is seriously insufficient, unable to mobilize enough human and material resources for the anti epidemic and disaster relief. Therefore, the prevention of the epidemic situation mainly depends on the residents' own behavior prevention, such as daily living habits. <br><br>

                Children of 6-12 years old naturally yearn for freedom and often participate in outdoor activities. However, such activities should be prohibited during the spread of the epidemic. Droplet transmission is the most important way of covid-19 transmission, but not the only way. Droplets will be produced in people's daily communication, so it is very dangerous to go out for activities. <br><br>

                At the same time, 6-12-year-old children's imitation ability is very strong, which leads to their thinking and easy to be guided by other people's wrong words and deeds, and even leads them to have incorrect cognition of covid-19 (for example, covid-19 does not exist) and make some wrong behaviors (such as not wearing masks when going out, incorrect washing hands, etc.). <br><br>

                Finally, most news reports and popular science propaganda mainly use a large number of words to describe, which are mainly applicable to adults. Children aged 6-12 will think that a large number of words are extremely boring, which will lead them to not seriously read the whole article. The game can attract children's attention through a large number of sound effects and visual effects. It is their concentration in the game, and the short dialogue sentences in the game are more suitable for children's reading ability. <br><br>

                So the members of our group hope to create this project to remind children aged 6-12 of the danger of covid-19 virus through games, special sound effects and visual effects, and popularize knowledge about virus prevention, such as some daily behaviors. Let children learn knowledge in the process of playing games, and teach them how to protect themselves. <br><br>

            <h2>Minimum Viable Features (MVF)</h2>
            <p class="p1">
                1.Statistical function of answer scores; <br>
                2.When the answer is correct, the system will give corresponding bonus points according to the difficulty of the question, ranging from 5 points to 15 points. When the answer is wrong The system will also give a 5-point deduction. After the end of the game, the system will give statistics, including the total score and the correct rate of different difficulty questions. <br><br>

                1.Sound characteristics of answering questions;<br>
                2.Correct and wrong answers will trigger different sound effects. The sound effect of correct answer sounds more positive, while the sound effect of wrong answer is slightly negative. We believe that setting such different sound effects can not only attract users' attention, but also motivate them to complete the answers. <br><br>

                1.Visual effects after completing the game;
                2.After completing the game, the game interface will generate an animation to celebrate the end of the user's answer, such as fireworks. We think that this setting can arouse users' sense of achievement and motivate them to continue to the next round of answering questions. <br><br>

                1.Publicity of popular science knowledge; <br>
                2.After each answer, even if the answer is correct, we will display the popular science knowledge on the interface in the form of picture and text or voice for users to learn. <br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Extended Viable Features (EVF)</h2>
            <p class="p1">
                1.Correct behavior detection function; <br>
                2. In the process of answering questions, the user can choose to turn on the camera to let the system record and judge whether the action is correct. For example, the correct way to wear a mask, the user demonstrates the method of wearing the mask step by step, and the system will record and judge whether the steps are correct and whether the wearing meets the requirements through the camera. <br><br>

                1. Function of community question answering contest;
                2. users can register an account to answer questions, and the score will be posted on the community ranking list and updated in real time. Different levels of competition will give different titles. This function can encourage users to answer questions and learn more in the process of the game.

                1. generate a map of epidemic situation; <br>
                2. according to the user's positioning, an epidemic situation map about the local area will be generated in the main interface, which will be updated every day, so that users can understand the epidemic situation in the nearby areas while playing the game. <br><br>

                1. family answer mode; <br>
                2. The family model can let the whole family participate in the game. Different from the personal mode, the family answering mode will be presented in the form of rushing to answer questions. This will not only enable more people to learn about covid-19 knowledge, but also promote the healthy development of family relations. <br><br>
