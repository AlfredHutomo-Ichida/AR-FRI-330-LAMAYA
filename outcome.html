            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>

            <p class="p1">
                As we all know, covid-19 suddenly appeared in the beginning of 2020. Because of its strong infectious, covid-19 has attracted people's attention and prevention. In recent months, the number of infections in Australia has been increasing rapidly, and some countries in the world are still indifferent to the virus. <br><br>

                After watching a lot of news reports, we think the real reason for the surge in infection cases in these countries is the different policies. Different from China, western countries generally implement the separation of powers, which leads to low efficiency. In addition, the central government and local governments act independently. In the face of the sudden epidemic, they lack strong and unified leadership, which leads to the serious lack of executive power of the government. Western countries are generally large society and small government, the ability of government to mobilize social resources is seriously insufficient, unable to mobilize enough human and material resources for the anti epidemic and disaster relief. Therefore, the prevention of the epidemic situation mainly depends on the residents' own behavior prevention, such as daily living habits. <br><br>

                Children of 6-12 years old naturally yearn for freedom and often participate in outdoor activities. However, such activities should be prohibited during the spread of the epidemic. Droplet transmission is the most important way of covid-19 transmission, but not the only way. Droplets will be produced in people's daily communication, so it is very dangerous to go out for activities. <br><br>

                At the same time, 6-12-year-old children's imitation ability is very strong, which leads to their thinking and easy to be guided by other people's wrong words and deeds, and even leads them to have incorrect cognition of covid-19 (for example, covid-19 does not exist) and make some wrong behaviors (such as not wearing masks when going out, incorrect washing hands, etc.). <br><br>

                Finally, most news reports and popular science propaganda mainly use a large number of words to describe, which are mainly applicable to adults. Children aged 6-12 will think that a large number of words are extremely boring, which will lead them to not seriously read the whole article. The game can attract children's attention through a large number of sound effects and visual effects. It is their concentration in the game, and the short dialogue sentences in the game are more suitable for children's reading ability. <br><br>

                So the members of our group hope to create this project to remind children aged 6-12 of the danger of covid-19 virus through games, special sound effects and visual effects, and popularize knowledge about virus prevention, such as some daily behaviors. Let children learn knowledge in the process of playing games, and teach them how to protect themselves.
