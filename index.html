			I have been studying a Bachelor of Information Technology for 4 years now, as I am a part time student. I 
			began my studies at Monash University, and transferred to RMIT Semester 2 2019. I have had an interest in 
			working in IT for about 10 years now, my first IT class in high school had me hooked on how computers could 
			do so much more than what we understood that they could do.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have always had strength in the front end aspects of Information technology. I love talking, and conveying
			the work being conducted in the back end part of projects is where I shine. I am currently studying a minor in 
			Management, hoping to enhance my leadership skills so as to be able to run projects successfully and lead teams 
			of people once my university degree is over. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Although I have been interested in IT for a long period of time now, I am still very fresh into the coding scene. 
			Being able to write code in a large number of languages is definitely not my strong point. Not due to lack of effort, 
			coding is something that does not compute in my brain, and I have partaken in many online coding courses and university 
			units trying to have an epiphany which is yet to arise. I feel comfortable working with HTML and CSS, but during this 
			project my weakness will be contributing at a high level in the formation of actually coding our website. 
		</p>

		</p>
			During this project, I expect to be performing more of a front end role. My strengths lie in design, coordinating people, 
	    		keeping people on track of tasks and ensuring requirements or in this case minimum viable products are met.

			I am currently in my second year of a Bachelor of Information Technology after I started mid-year in 2019. 
			I originally started a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne at the start pf 2019, 
			however I transferred to RMIT after discovering that it wasn’t for me. I have always been interested
			in IT and computers, and tinkering and fixing technology, however it was something that never came 
			naturally to me so that is why I initially did not pursue it. When I quickly lost interest in my 
			humanities degree, I decided to just give it a shot, and I am still very happy with my decision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have always been interested in the physical components of IT, such as putting together PCs as 
			well as troubleshooting any tech problems that I had in my household. I like fixing things and 
			making them work again as I find it very satisfying and always feel a sense of accomplishment when 
			a problem is solved. I initially did not think that I was interested in coding, however the more I 
			learn the more I find that I like the challenge of it and the problem solving nature. I am doing a minor 
			in Networking which also gives me an opportunity to work with physical components such as routers and cables.
		</p>
		<p>
			My weaknesses lie in time management which is something that I often let get away from me. I often leave my 
			own work till the last minute, which can be a big burden when working in a team, as is the case quite often in 
			the IT/Tech world. I like to be a team player though and pull my own weight, so I often am able to push myself a 
			little further to ensure that the group can excel.
		</p>
		<p>
			During this project, I expect to work partially with the coding of the project, as well as with some of the design 
			aspect of the game that we are creating. 
		</p>

				<p> I’ve always been passionate about IT but when a high school friend told me her parents were hired by companies to hack their own systems, this drew my attention, I started to take IT classes and became interested in the world of security.
				I have a base knowledge of python, java, html and css. I am particularly interested in the Security side of IT, specifically ethical hacking, and bug bounties.
				My weaker points in the context of the project are time management, drawing or creating the background artwork we will be using and 
				The role I expect to be taking is either code or story based </p>

			I have been studying a Bachelor of Information Technology for 3 years now.I come from China and I have learned a little about C; Java; Python; HTML and database. I think the computer will be the future of science and technology development, and I also hope to be able to learn information technology to develop a world popular software, make the world a better place;
		</p>

		<p>
			Among the four codes I studied, I think my HTML and python abilities are relatively strong. At the same time, I am more interested in Python machine learning and database;
		</p>

		<p>
			I think in our project, my weakness will be animation. I am not very familiar with the animation code;
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope I can use CSS to beautify our project, such as the sound effect of score; the visual effect of score; and the visual prompt of wrong answer.
