            <h2>Abigail Dineen | s3807423</h2>
		<p>
			I have been studying a Bachelor of Information Technology for 4 years now, as I am a part time student. I 
			began my studies at Monash University, and transferred to RMIT Semester 2 2019. I have had an interest in 
			working in IT for about 10 years now, my first IT class in high school had me hooked on how computers could 
			do so much more than what we understood that they could do.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have always had strength in the front end aspects of Information technology. I love talking, and conveying
			the work being conducted in the back end part of projects is where I shine. I am currently studying a minor in 
			Management, hoping to enhance my leadership skills so as to be able to run projects successfully and lead teams 
			of people once my university degree is over. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Although I have been interested in IT for a long period of time now, I am still very fresh into the coding scene. 
			Being able to write code in a large number of languages is definitely not my strong point. Not due to lack of effort, 
			coding is something that does not compute in my brain, and I have partaken in many online coding courses and university 
			units trying to have an epiphany which is yet to arise. I feel comfortable working with HTML and CSS, but during this 
			project my weakness will be contributing at a high level in the formation of actually coding our website. 
		</p>

		</p>
			During this project, I expect to be performing more of a front end role. My strengths lie in design, coordinating people, 
	    		keeping people on track of tasks and ensuring requirements or in this case minimum viable products are met.
		</p>

				<p> Iâ€™ve always been passionate about IT but when a high school friend told me her parents were hired by companies to hack their own systems, this drew my attention, I started to take IT classes and became interested in the world of security.
				I have a base knowledge of python, java, html and css. I am particularly interested in the Security side of IT, specifically ethical hacking, and bug bounties.
				My weaker points in the context of the project are time management, drawing or creating the background artwork we will be using and 
				The role I expect to be taking is either code or story based </p>

		<p>
			I come from China and have learned a little about C; Java; Python; HTML and database. I think the computer will be the future of science and technology development, and I also hope to be able to learn information technology to develop a world popular software, make the world a better place;
		</p>

		<p>
			Among the four codes I studied, I think my HTML and python abilities are relatively strong. At the same time, I am more interested in Python machine learning and database;
		</p>

		<p>
			I think in our project, my weakness will be animation. I am not very familiar with the animation code;
		</p>

		<p>
			I hope I can use CSS to beautify our project, such as the sound effect of score; the visual effect of score; and the visual prompt of wrong answer.
