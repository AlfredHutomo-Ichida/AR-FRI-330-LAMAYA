				<p> Iâ€™ve always been passionate about IT but when a high school friend told me her parents were hired by companies to hack their own systems, this drew my attention, I started to take IT classes and became interested in the world of security.
				I have a base knowledge of python, java, html and css. I am particularly interested in the Security side of IT, specifically ethical hacking, and bug bounties.
				My weaker points in the context of the project are time management, drawing or creating the background artwork we will be using and 
				The role I expect to be taking is either code or story based </p>
