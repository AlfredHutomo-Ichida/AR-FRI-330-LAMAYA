		<h3> Project Processes </h3><br>
		<p> Throughout this assignment, Lamaya learned how to work well together. Initially each task was completed separately by each member and combined somewhat haphazardly, but by the end we were able to have multiple members working simultaneously on the same MVFs without impacting each other negatively. This allowed seamless integration of our work, and made it seem more fluid and smoother.  Over the course of the last 12 weeks our group communication has become a lot smoother, though there have still been a couple small hiccups. To start with, our communication channels were barely used outside of our group meetings and for the most part we did not talk outside of those. As we got more familiar with each other though we started to use our teams chat more frequently, as well as making a discord group so that we could communicate easier, even if someone were not at home on their computer. Our two biggest problems as a group were time management and a team member not pulling their weight. Often, we would complete a week’s tasks minutes before our group meeting, this put extra stress on us as well as reduced the quality of some of our work. This would make us go back in the following week to improve what we had done and thus taking more time from the tasks for that week. Eventually, we did get on top of this and started completing tasks earlier in the week and then only making aesthetic changes closer to the meetings and expected due dates. There were signs early on that Oliver (Yuqing) was not quite as reliable as we hoped. He was late to meetings, wouldn’t speak during meetings and did not respond to messages. We hoped that as the project moved on this would improve, it did not. He regularly did not complete the work expected from him and if he did, it either would not work or wasn’t to the standard that we wanted. Over the course of the project we got more used to this and started to make backup plans for if he did not complete his work. </p>
		<br>
		<p> During our weekly meetings with ABM Russel, he helped shape our project, by giving us feedback on what worked well, what needed improvement and what was lacking. Thanks to his feedback we were able to create an incredible looking end goal as well as a fully functional text-based adventure.</p>
		<br>
		<p> Early on, in our meetings with Dr B, he told us to make sure that our project was different, that it was not something that had been done before. We worked very hard to make sure that our website was unique and different from anything out there. The way we did this was by shifting our target audience, creating incredible drawings for each page and each item on our site. Initially our target audience was older primary school kids, but after one of our meetings with Dr B, we thought it might be more beneficial if we targeted young primary school kids. Closer to the end of our project Dr B also gave us feedback on our answer checking functions. He said rather than to fully create our own, utilise one that already exists. So, we did, but making small adjustments so that it would do exactly what we needed. </p>
		<br>
		<p> We thought it important that if a group member had any issues with a task, they could use teams to ask for help. This worked very well as it allowed multiple different perspectives on tasks that put them in a new light and so could be completed in an unexpected way. We had to make a few small changes to our original plan to ensure that we could finish on time. Firstly, we had to abandon the fading between pages that we intended, as this was much harder to do than we realised and soon, it started digging in to the time reserved for other features, so it was abandoned. Initially we planned on providing a voiceover for each of the tasks so that the website would be more accessible to those who are hard of sight and those who are still developing their reading skills. Sadly, due to the team member responsible having to pick up large parts of Oliver’s work, this too was abandoned. </p>
		<br>
		<p> The most important part of organising a project of this nature is to make sure that every member knows what they are responsible for, have support from the others if they need it and a backup plan for if a group member does not complete their portion of the work. To do this we took note of everyone’s skills and split tasks accordingly, and each new task was listed in teams in our meeting minutes to make sure we knew what we had to do. If we were to do this again, we would try to prepare more for if a group member slips up or does not complete their tasks.
The advice I would give to a group about to embark on this project, is to make sure that you can trust each member of the group, to complete their work in a timely manner and to a high standard. Also do not be afraid to ask your group members for help on anything you might not understand, they are there to help you, after all this assignment is about working as a group.</p>
