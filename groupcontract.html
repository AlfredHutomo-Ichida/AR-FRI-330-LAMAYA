    <h1>LAMAYA Group Contract</h1>

    <h2>Communication Expectations</h2>

    <p>
      The group will have consitent meetings during the allocated hours every Fridays 3:45PM to 5:00PM.
      More group meetings may be arranged if needed for all team members participation.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will all rely on using Microsoft Teams as the main communication method. All 
      team members should need to respond on messages in the team app by 24 hours. If neccessary 
      we can use other social media to communicate with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trello can use used to identify what people have done, but also using Teams to communicate 
      directly with each other to get responses is helpful as well. Trello keeps individuals on task, 
      with the ability to cross things off, whereas teams can keep us discussing issues more freely. 
    </p>

    <h2>Decision-making Processes</h2>

    <p>
      When there is a decision need to be made there will be a person in charge for the team task 
      this will be determined by the timeline we have created. If there is a big decision need to 
      be solve consult with the whole team before taking action.
