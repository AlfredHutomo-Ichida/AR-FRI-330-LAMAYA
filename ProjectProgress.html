			As stated above, having one team member who did not participate impacted our timeline and production. 
			The development and design of the website took significantly longer than we had estimated. In our timeline, 
			we estimated that the development of the website would only take 2 weeks, those being weeks 6 to 8. However,
			the website was not constructed until the conclusion of week 9. This immediately put our work behind schedule,
			as we had spent significantly longer on the design and research phase. Each team member was prepared to 
			research as they worked on the production, however, we received feedback from ABM Russel who suggested this was
			not a helpful way to go. The website design itself has continued since its initial construction at the end of 
			week 9, to the end of week 12. As we are constantly making adjustments in order to improve the positioning of
			our elements and aiming to make it more accessible and easy to use for the children, we needed to get the core
			MVF’s working and functioning first before we could finalise our design. According to our timeline, we also had
			only two team members working on the javaScript. This was not the case, as each member of our team needed to 
			conduct their own research in order to work in accordance with our 5 MVFs. In addition to these delays, the 
			design of characters, backgrounds and miscellaneous objects took almost 6 weeks to achieve. This is because we
			as a team under-estimated the time needed to draw these objects and characters by just 2 people. Besides all of 
			the above, the remainder of our progress was completed in line with our timetable. Please see the timeline page
			to understand what the above references are made to, as well as the ‘Done’ swimlane in trello.
