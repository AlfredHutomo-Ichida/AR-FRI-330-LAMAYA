		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			In our first meeting, we discussed many different ideas surrounding what we would develop. Keeping
			in mind that we wanted our concept to be modern and applicable to each of us, we felt that a COVID-19
			centred application would be appropriate. After discussing our planned idea with Dr B, we came to the 
			conclusion that it was vital for us to narrow down this broad idea, so we solidified on the concept of
			a children’s interactive and education game discussing and teaching the dangers of COVID-19 in Victoria,
			and the steps we take as a society to prevent it’s spread.
			<br>
			Compared to the plan, we were originally held back by the lack of one member’s participation. After much
			effort and communication, we needed to continue along with elements that had been left behind. Instead, making
			a focus to work as a group of 5, all of us had to compensate for this. This decision was also vital to the 
			progression of our work, as we had limited time to wait with only 12 weeks to complete this project during semester.
			Although challenging, we managed to produce a comprehensive project, as well as detailed and well worked assignments,
			regardless of working with one team member less. 
			<br>
			All of the work breakdown elements can be noted on our <a href = "timeline.html">Timeline</a>
			page. To summarise, Abigail and Layne constructed the storyline, as well as Layne focussed on the production of the voiceover
			and assisted quite significantly to the development of 2 Minimum Viable Features. Abigail continued her work with the storyline,
			to create the activity pages, as well as worked significantly with the production of the animation MVF. Angela worked closely
			with Megan, producing some of the miscellaneous and background design, while also collaborating with Layne and Alfred on the
			final MVF's that were completed. Megan heavily focussed on the remaining design work, including all activity backgrounds and
			the design of characters. She then worked with Angela to implement these into HTML and place them within the screen. Alfred worked significantly on
			the understanding of javaScript, and aimed to help all team members with areas that their understanding was lacking. Each of the
			above mentioned 5 team members all collaborated well, in order to successfully complete the 5 MVF's as originally set out to do so. Yuqing Wu
			one some occasions appeared online with little communication and contribution.
			Each team members weekly tasks can be viewed in their individual swimlanes on Trello:

			We originally were aiming to develop 10 activities for the children. However, once we began developing the storyline
			and ideas for our activities, we reached a stalemate in varying concepts. We were able to produce 7 functioning 
			activities, which we are happy with, but this was also a slight change of plans. 
			<br>
			Because the 5 minimum viable features we created were specific in their nature, but broad in the way to make
			them come about, we were able to change our minds if elements of our MVF were not working. For example, when we were 
			developing the animation MVF, we originally had the idea of creating a transition between each activity. However, after
			hours of research and attempts to implement, we decided to animate our self-designed images and objects. This still 
			satisfied the animation element of our MVF, but was a change to our original plan.
			<br>
			When we discuss aspects of this project that we would have liked to have completed, we note that due to time constraints
			we were unable to achieve any of our Extended Viable Features, noted on our <a href = "outcome.html">Demonstrable Outcomes</a>
			page. 
			Our team meetings were recorded, and can be found at <a href = "https://trello.com/c/HUdQY1N8/105-meeting-links">our Team Meeting Links swimlane</a>

		<h2>Outcomes to Date</h2>
		<p>
			As a team, we were successfully able to complete all 5 of our Minimum Viable Features, by
			incorporating this into 7 COVID-19 based activities designed for children. These can be 
			depicted in the screenshots and screen recordings below:
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Extended Viable Features (EVF)</h2>
		<h3>EVF 1: Correct Behaviour Detection</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF1.png" alt = "EVF1" width = 400px, height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This mockup encapsulates EVF1: the Correct behaviour detection. In this EVF, the 
			user is able to turn on their camera to demonstrate an action, which will be assessed
			instead of the writing or clicking of the correct answer. The simplicity of this mockup
			allows for the user to follow the instructions given, and then click on the camera button
			to access their camera screen. This will also come with a pop up, allowing the user to 
			accept that they are turning their camera screen on and to allow this to go ahead. 
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a blind student, I want to be able to demonstrate the correct COVID-19 responses to
			situations so that my learning is not hindered by my low quality of sight.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 2: Function of Community Answer Contest (Community Scoreboard)</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF2.png" alt = "EVF2" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a demonstration of EVF2. In this EVF, the user signs in/creates an account and
			becomes part of a community driven group, whereby high scores are accumulated and become 
			an aim for users to achieve and beat. This would only be possible if we were able to also 
			create more activities for the children to participate in.	
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a child, I want to see the leaderboard of my peers so that I can know how other students
			my age are understanding the content, and can aim to improve my own knowledge in a competitive 
			environment.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 3: Map of Epidemic across Melbourne</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF3.png" alt = "EVF3" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a mockup of EVF3, which encapsulates a map of the pandemic in your local area. 
			The pin represents positive COVID-19 tests, and the user would be able to search for the suburb in the search bar provided.	
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>	
			As an educator, I want to know where the COVID-19 hotspots are so that I can encourage families and students to 
			stay safe and away from the pandemic areas.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 4: Family answer mode</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF4.png" alt = "EVF4" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a mockup of EVF4, which is a family answer mode. The instructions and questions would be provided on the screen, 
			and using a personal device, the users can scan the QR code and access the personal section. Once all players have accessed
			the QR code, the game can begin. This will also produce a scoreboard for the family members, as seen in EVF2.
			
		</p>
		<h4>User Stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a parent, I want to engage with my child's education so that I can understand their learning capabilities and assist them to 
			broaden their knowledge.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Scope Creep</h2>
		<p>
			We spent significantly longer on the design phase, which meant we had to compress our time frame for production. This resulted
			in a higher need for developing the project in a much tighter timeframe. Should the class have continued beyond the 12 weeks, 
			it could have created scope creep. As we had delegated individuals for varying parts of the workload, in order to avoid scope 
			creep we could have every team member working on every aspect of the development. 
			Also, because we were vague in our expectations for each MVF, it meant there was significant ambiguity and room for errors to occur, 
			as well as a broad misunderstanding of what was expected. This created scope creep, as simplistic tasks took significantly longer than
			we had assigned them to take.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Windfall</h2>
		<p>
			The animation that we had spent a significant amount of time trying to establish using javascript and CSS was actually 
			created using HTML, once we had cohesively readjusted our idea. After spending hours experimenting and learning about
			animation with javascript, the changing of our mind meant that the actual work we completed for animation took significantly longer 
			than the initial experimentation. If we as a team had've been clearer with our expectations and goals, we would have 
			moved on from the animation MVF much faster than we had expected.
			In addition, the production of the script and its contents, as well as the ideas behind the concepts we would draw also occurred
			significantly faster than we had expected. The script and ideas for each activity came about within 1 week, and the ideas of characters 
			to draw were suggested also within a 1 week timeframe. The implementation of these two ideas, however, took significantly longer, as seen
			above.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Progress</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			As stated above, having one team member who did not participate impacted our timeline and production. 
			The development and design of the website took significantly longer than we had estimated. In our timeline, 
			we estimated that the development of the website would only take 2 weeks, those being weeks 6 to 8. However,
			the website was not constructed until the conclusion of week 9. This immediately put our work behind schedule,
			as we had spent significantly longer on the design and research phase. Each team member was prepared to 
			research as they worked on the production, however, we received feedback from ABM Russel who suggested this was
			not a helpful way to go. The website design itself has continued since its initial construction at the end of 
			week 9, to the end of week 12. As we are constantly making adjustments in order to improve the positioning of
			our elements and aiming to make it more accessible and easy to use for the children, we needed to get the core
			MVF’s working and functioning first before we could finalise our design. According to our timeline, we also had
			only two team members working on the javaScript. This was not the case, as each member of our team needed to 
			conduct their own research in order to work in accordance with our 5 MVFs. In addition to these delays, the 
			design of characters, backgrounds and miscellaneous objects took almost 6 weeks to achieve. This is because we
			as a team under-estimated the time needed to draw these objects and characters by just 2 people. Besides all of 
			the above, the remainder of our progress was completed in line with our timetable. Please see the <a href = "timeline.html">Timeline</a> page
			to understand what the above references are made to, as well as the ‘Done’ swimlane in our <a href = "https://trello.com/b/aEB9CfrA/am-fr-330-lamaya">Trello board</a>.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<p>
			We had to test amongst ourselves. There was no opportunity for testing beyond our team, as our design phase
				took longer than we had planned for. We often would test our work in a separate document, as to not affect 
				the overall collaboration that occurred on GitHub. Because our testing of the above mentioned animation 
				section took significantly longer to become functional, we were behind schedule and needed a change as a
				group. Originally, we had hoped to test with school aged children, as team members have younger siblings/family
				members who we could have tested this product with. But due to our delay in progress, we were unable to do so.
