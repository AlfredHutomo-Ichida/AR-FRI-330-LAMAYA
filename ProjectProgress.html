		<h2>Description</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>Outcomes to Date</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>Extended Viable Features (EVF)</h2>
		<h3>EVF 1: Correct Behaviour Detection</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF1.png" alt = "EVF1" width = 400px, height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This mockup encapsulates EVF1: the Correct behaviour detection. In this EVF, the 
			user is able to turn on their camera to demonstrate an action, which will be assessed
			instead of the writing or clicking of the correct answer. The simplicity of this mockup
			allows for the user to follow the instructions given, and then click on the camera button
			to access their camera screen. This will also come with a pop up, allowing the user to 
			accept that they are turning their camera screen on and to allow this to go ahead. 
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a blind student, I want to be able to demonstrate the correct COVID-19 responses to
			situations so that my learning is not hindered by my low quality of sight.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 2: Function of Community Answer Contest (Community Scoreboard)</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF2.png" alt = "EVF2" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a demonstration of EVF2. In this EVF, the user signs in/creates an account and
			becomes part of a community driven group, whereby high scores are accumulated and become 
			an aim for users to achieve and beat. This would only be possible if we were able to also 
			create more activities for the children to participate in.	
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a child, I want to see the leaderboard of my peers so that I can know how other students
			my age are understanding the content, and can aim to improve my own knowledge in a competitive 
			environment.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 3: Map of Epidemic across Melbourne</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF3.png" alt = "EVF3" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a mockup of EVF3, which encapsulates a map of the pandemic in your local area. 
			The pin represents positive COVID-19 tests, and the user would be able to search for the suburb in the search bar provided.	
		</p>
		<h4>User stories</h4>
		<p>	
			As an educator, I want to know where the COVID-19 hotspots are so that I can encourage families and students to 
			stay safe and away from the pandemic areas.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>EVF 4: Family answer mode</h3>
		<h4>Mockup</h4>
		<img src = "images/EVF4.png" alt = "EVF4" width = 400px height = 400px>
		<h4>Text Descriptions</h4>
		<p>
			This is a mockup of EVF4, which is a family answer mode. The instructions and questions would be provided on the screen, 
			and using a personal device, the users can scan the QR code and access the personal section. Once all players have accessed
			the QR code, the game can begin. This will also produce a scoreboard for the family members, as seen in EVF2.
			
		</p>
		<h4>User Stories</h4>
		<p>
			As a parent, I want to engage with my child's education so that I can understand their learning capabilities and assist them to 
			broaden their knowledge.
		</p>

		<h2>Scope Creep</h2>
		<p>
			We spent significantly longer on the design phase, which meant we had to compress our time frame for production. This resulted
			in a higher need for developing the project in a much tighter timeframe. Should the class have continued beyond the 12 weeks, 
			it could have created scope creep. As we had delegated individuals for varying parts of the workload, in order to avoid scope 
			creep we could have every team member working on every aspect of the development. 
			Also, because we were vague in our expectations for each MVF, it meant there was significant ambiguity and room for errors to occur, 
			as well as a broad misunderstanding of what was expected. This created scope creep, as simplistic tasks took significantly longer than
			we had assigned them to take.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Windfall</h2>
		<p>
			The animation that we had spent a significant amount of time trying to establish using javascript and CSS was actually 
			created using HTML, once we had cohesively readjusted our idea. After spending hours experimenting and learning about
			animation with javascript, the changing of our mind meant that the actual work we completed for animation took significantly longer 
			than the initial experimentation. If we as a team had've been clearer with our expectations and goals, we would have 
			moved on from the animation MVF much faster than we had expected.
			In addition, the production of the script and its contents, as well as the ideas behind the concepts we would draw also occurred
			significantly faster than we had expected. The script and ideas for each activity came about within 1 week, and the ideas of characters 
			to draw were suggested also within a 1 week timeframe. The implementation of these two ideas, however, took significantly longer, as seen
			above.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Progress</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			As stated above, having one team member who did not participate impacted our timeline and production. 
			The development and design of the website took significantly longer than we had estimated. In our timeline, 
			we estimated that the development of the website would only take 2 weeks, those being weeks 6 to 8. However,
			the website was not constructed until the conclusion of week 9. This immediately put our work behind schedule,
			as we had spent significantly longer on the design and research phase. Each team member was prepared to 
			research as they worked on the production, however, we received feedback from ABM Russel who suggested this was
			not a helpful way to go. The website design itself has continued since its initial construction at the end of 
			week 9, to the end of week 12. As we are constantly making adjustments in order to improve the positioning of
			our elements and aiming to make it more accessible and easy to use for the children, we needed to get the core
			MVF’s working and functioning first before we could finalise our design. According to our timeline, we also had
			only two team members working on the javaScript. This was not the case, as each member of our team needed to 
			conduct their own research in order to work in accordance with our 5 MVFs. In addition to these delays, the 
			design of characters, backgrounds and miscellaneous objects took almost 6 weeks to achieve. This is because we
			as a team under-estimated the time needed to draw these objects and characters by just 2 people. Besides all of 
			the above, the remainder of our progress was completed in line with our timetable. Please see the <a href = "timeline.html">Timeline</a> page
			to understand what the above references are made to, as well as the ‘Done’ swimlane in our <a href = https://trello.com/b/aEB9CfrA/am-fr-330-lamaya">Trello board</a>.
