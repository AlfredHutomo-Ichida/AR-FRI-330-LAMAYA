		<h2>Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now? </h2>
		<p>
		I was in charge of creating the timetable after discussing it as a group, and I believe that it is a realistic timetable overall. Since it was everyoneâ€™s first time creating a text-based game, I tried to be generous with the amount of time given for each specific task. I gave almost every task a time span of 2 weeks to complete so we are able to research and learn required information before implementing the features. I think it is a realistic representation of what our group contributed and completed over the weeks.
		
		If I had to change the timetable, I would have given less time for the website development and design, since a few of my members have learnt how to use HTML/CSS throughout the semester, therefore have improved in this particular part of the project. They would require less time to build the website, and I would thus use the extra time gained to focus on the JavaScript and other extra features of the project, such as animation and sound. 
		I would also change the time to work on the storyline to 1 week, as it was an easier part of the project that my team members completed within a week. Changing this would have given us an extra week to start on another task, which would be better in terms of time management. Moreover, as it is already Week 12, I believe that the testing and finalising of the project should only take a week as it did not require as much time as the other delegated tasks.
