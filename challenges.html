         <h3>Challenges & Learning</h3>
         <p>
            This is the overall summary of the group's opinions regarding the questions given. Below it, is a table showing in dot points each
            member's opinions for each question.
         </p>
         <p></p>

         <h3>What have you found easy?</h3>
         <p>
            As a group, we found it easy to work with other team members. We all agreed that our overall communication was excellent as we mostly
            attended all group meetings and made sure to stay up to date with all delegated tasks. A few members are also comfortable in using HTML
            and CSS, which was the main programming languages for our project.
         </p>

         <h3>What have you found difficult?</h3>
         <p>
            Our group agreed that it was very difficult for us to manage our time well as we have a large workload for not only this project but also
            for other units as well. Moreover, we found keeping up with deadlines and remembering what tasks are needed to be completed, especially
            since we were not used to using Trello.
         </p>

         <h3>What was unexpected?</h3>
         <p>
            Most of the group members were overwhelmed by how much work was needed to create our project, as we needed to consistently deliver our
            parts of the project every week. Moreover, it was unexpected to some of the group members of how well we all worked together despite only
            meeting for the first time. However, a few members complained how one of our group members did not contribute to anything and thus felt
            like we lost a member.
         </p>

         <h3>In what ways have you been stretched?</h3>
         <p>
            As a group, we all agreed that it was difficult to ensure that we had something to deliver and present every week as the tasks for the
            project was a lot more time consuming that we thought. For example, a group member thought that some drawings took too much time to
            design, while another found it difficult to work with other people’s codes as it had different styles. Another group member mentioned how
            learning JavaScript took much longer than they thought as it was a lot more complicated to create complex functions.
         </p>

         <h3>What challenges were you expecting? What have you done to address this? Have they been overcome?</h3>
         <p>
            Our group’s main challenge that we were expecting was lack of communication within team members, as we had to work online due to COVID-19.
            As none of us could meet in person, and we all didn't know each other very well, it was natural for all of us to be anxious in terms of
            communicating and working with each other. One member mentioned how difficult it will be to work together as we don't know each other and
            we each have our own different ways of working. Moreover, a few members were not as active on Teams, thus was hard to contact them and
            keep updated with their contributions. To address these problems, all of our group members took initiative to attend all group meetings to
            make sure that we are able to communicate any problems as well as allocate tasks and ensure that we are all on the right track. As we got
            more comfortable working together, we all learnt how to adapt to each other’s working styles and habits, and overcame the worry of team
            member’s not doing their tasks. Moreover, one of our team members that raised concern over the lack of replies on Teams created a group
            chat on a different messaging platform in case they are inactive on Teams. With these solutions, we were able to overcome the main initial
            worry of the project.
         </p>

         <h3>What are the new skills/experiences you have learned? And those that haven’t worked out.</h3>
         <p>
            Majority of the group members have learnt how to use JavaScript, as it was needed in to making the complex interactive activities for the
            project. Moreover, a few members have learnt how to draw digitally, as well as learn how to code in HTML and CSS, as well as coding
            collaboratively, specifically on GitHub. A few other members also mentioned using Microsoft Teams as a main form of communication was a
            new experience for them, as we were all fairly new to working on a team project online. This helped with the overall team experience, and
            amplified the importance of communication within the group members.
         </p>

         <h3>
            Did you make any changes in your plan? Have things turned out as you expected? What would you do differently if you had your time over
            again?
         </h3>
         <p>
            A few group members mentioned how the original idea was too ambitious as we were all excited to create a text-based game, such as
            voice-overs, complex animations and more interactive images. As we realised how difficult it was to develop this project, we later
            realised that we didn't have enough time to complete these ideas, thus a lot of changes were made to the game. We believed a fully
            functional game was more important as we wanted to also meet the deadline, so we removed the extra functions that were too time consuming
            and focused on working on the functionality of the game itself. Furthermore, a few group members ended up taking on more tasks than
            originally expected due to one of our team members not contributing to the project. They had to take on more tasks, especially in coding
            which was difficult as they had no experience with it beforehand. However, they managed to distribute their tasks evenly to the group and
            worked hard to overcome this problem. In the end, our group project was completed and fully functional and overall, the whole group is
            satisfied with the project and we are proud to be able to bring it all together on time.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our group had different opinions when asked if we could do things differently. A few group members mentioned that they would like to
            manage their time better to ensure they get their work done on time, and to save themselves from unnecessary stress. Another group member
            would have liked to be paired up with a person that can work well with them, as they found coding collaboratively a lot easier than
            working solo. One other group member mentioned how they would have liked to try and relax more as the project was worrying for them
            because of time constraints and unexpected problems within the development of the project.
         </p>

         <h3>Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now?</h3>
         <p>
            I was in charge of creating the timetable after discussing it as a group, and I believe that it is a realistic timetable overall. Since it
            was everyone’s first time creating a text-based game, I tried to be generous with the amount of time given for each specific task. I gave
            almost every task a time span of 2 weeks to complete so we are able to research and learn required information before implementing the
            features. I think it is a realistic representation of what our group contributed and completed over the weeks. <br />

            If I had to change the timetable, I would have given less time for the website development and design, since a few of my members have
            learnt how to use HTML/CSS throughout the semester, therefore have improved in this particular part of the project. They would require
            less time to build the website, and I would thus use the extra time gained to focus on the JavaScript and other extra features of the
            project, such as animation and sound. <br />

            I would also change the time to work on the storyline to 1 week, as it was an easier part of the project that my team members completed
            within a week. Changing this would have given us an extra week to start on another task, which would be better in terms of time
            management. Moreover, as it is already Week 12, I believe that the testing and finalising of the project should only take a week as it did
            not require as much time as the other delegated tasks. <br /><br />
         </p>

         <h3>
            Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialised? Have there been unanticipated
            events affecting your progress?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Our collaborative workspaces that we used has worked out perfectly. By using Github, our common repository, we have been able to
            collaborative work on the code of our project as a group. We also used Trello to keep updated with our weekly tasks, and that has helped
            our group stay organised. Our main communication software, Microsoft Teams, has also worked perfectly and helped our group immensely and
            overall was a great form of communication during online learning period. <br /><br />

            Other tools and software such as Figma and Balsamiq for our website design, as well as Procreate for the drawings, worked perfectly and
            was a great tool for us in the design aspects of the website and game. Moreover, our main programming software, Visual Studio Code, has
            worked out as expected, and has been mainly used to code our game and website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br />

            One of the risks mentioned was that team members are not fluent in JavaScript, which is the coding language that plays a big role for our
            project. This did materialise as our group struggled with some JavaScript features such as complex animation and transition of the game.
            However, our group has managed to still learn and implement simple JavaScript in the project. Another risk that was materialised was that
            the design of characters and items within the application cannot be made interactive. As our EVF includes interactive images that move
            with alternate backgrounds, it is too difficult for our limited knowledge of animation thus preventing us from achieving that. However, we
            have still completed our MVF, which includes our images to be static and displayed on the website. <br />

            Lastly, the risk mentioned as team members not attending team meetings as also materialised. As many students are busy with school and
            other priorities, it is sometimes difficult to attend meetings every week. This however, makes it difficult for group members to allocate
            tasks or to stay updated with the project. It also prevents them from voicing any concerns or to communicate ideas to the group. At some
            points of the semester, there were occasions where a few team members were unable to attend group meetings, thus played a big risk in the
            project. <br /><br />

            Overall, there weren’t many unanticipated events affecting our progress since as a group, we consistently stayed organised and updated in
            our weekly meetings, and each member had a delegated task that was always completed before deadlines. We all worked contributed to our
            parts and any concerns and problems were always mentioned to the group. <br />

            The only main unanticipated event was when our project idea was at its initial stages and we were still unsure of the target audience and
            concept. As we later agreed on making it a children’s game, our initial idea of creating a story-based game was later changed to a more
            colourful and simple game with images and interactive activities. This was unanticipated as we all had limited coding knowledge and none
            of our group members were confident in drawing and designing the game, therefore was difficult to adjust our project idea, and we were
            worried if we were able to complete this within a limited time. <br /><br />
