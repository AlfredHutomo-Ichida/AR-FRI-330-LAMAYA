		<h3>Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now?</h3>
		<p>I was in charge of creating the timetable after discussing it as a group, and I believe that it is a realistic timetable overall. Since it was everyone’s first time creating a text-based game, I tried to be generous with the amount of time given for each specific task. I gave almost every task a time span of 2 weeks to complete so we are able to research and learn required information before implementing the features. I think it is a realistic representation of what our group contributed and completed over the weeks.
		If I had to change the timetable, I would have given less time for the website development and design, since a few of my members have learnt how to use HTML/CSS throughout the semester, therefore have improved in this particular part of the project. They would require less time to build the website, and I would thus use the extra time gained to focus on the JavaScript and other extra features of the project, such as animation and sound. 
		I would also change the time to work on the storyline to 1 week, as it was an easier part of the project that my team members completed within a week. Changing this would have given us an extra week to start on another task, which would be better in terms of time management. Moreover, as it is already Week 12, I believe that the testing and finalising of the project should only take a week as it did not require as much time as the other delegated tasks.

		<h3>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialised? Have there been unanticipated events affecting your progress?</h3>
		<p>Our collaborative workspaces that we used has worked out perfectly. By using Github, our common repository, we have been able to collaborative work on the code of our project as a group. We also used Trello to keep updated with our weekly tasks, and that has helped our group stay organised. Our main communication software, Microsoft Teams, has also worked perfectly and helped our group immensely and overall was a great form of communication during online learning period. Other tools and software such as Figma and Balsamiq for our website design, as well as Procreate for the drawings, worked perfectly and was a great tool for us in the design aspects of the website and game. Moreover, our main programming software, Visual Studio Code, has worked out as expected, and has been mainly used to code our game and website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
		One of the risks mentioned was that team members are not fluent in JavaScript, which is the coding language that plays a big role for our project. This did materialise as our group struggled with some JavaScript features such as complex animation and transition of the game. However, our group has managed to still learn and implement simple JavaScript in the project. Another risk that was materialised was that the design of characters and items within the application cannot be made interactive. As our EVF includes interactive images that move with alternate backgrounds, it is too difficult for our limited knowledge of animation thus preventing us from achieving that. However, we have still completed our MVF, which includes our images to be static and displayed on the website. Lastly, the risk mentioned as team members not attending team meetings as also materialised. As many students are busy with school and other priorities, it is sometimes difficult to attend meetings every week. This however, makes it difficult for group members to allocate tasks or to stay updated with the project. It also prevents them from voicing any concerns or to communicate ideas to the group. At some points of the semester, there were occasions where a few team members were unable to attend group meetings, thus played a big risk in the project.
		Overall, there weren’t many unanticipated events affecting our progress since as a group, we consistently stayed organised and updated in our weekly meetings, and each member had a delegated task that was always completed before deadlines. We all worked contributed to our parts and any concerns and problems were always mentioned to the group. The only main unanticipated event was when our project idea was at its initial stages and we were still unsure of the target audience and concept. As we later agreed on making it a children’s game, our initial idea of creating a story-based game was later changed to a more colourful and simple game with images and interactive activities. This was unanticipated as we all had limited coding knowledge and none of our group members were confident in drawing and designing the game, therefore was difficult to adjust our project idea, and we were worried if we were able to complete this within a limited time.
