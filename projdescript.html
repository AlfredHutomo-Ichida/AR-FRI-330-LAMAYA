               As a group we thought it would be a good idea to tackle something that is relevant and informative, so the project that we will be working on is a text-based adventure using the current pandemic as inspiration. The aim of this project is to teach younger kids the facts behind COVID-19, and not just the scare tactics. Hidden inside this will also be a way to teach these kids proper typing skills. Initially we were thinking of a website that would track local cases so people could check to see if it was safe to leave their house, however this idea would have been difficult to create as weâ€™d need to use a combination of government information as well as user inputs. Following this we had the thought that a lot of children seem to be told what to do, but not why they need to do it. This might cause these children to become scared and unruly so we thought it might be a good idea to educate them on this manner, and to ensure that they will actually want to learn we had to make it interactive and fun, hence the game format. In our current day and age typing is an essential skill so we thought that if we made our game text based it would help them learn to do so.

			 Our project will be a web app as well as a game. We will measure their typing accuracy and efficiency, their knowledge of how to protect themselves from COVID in certain situations and the speed at which they perform these tasks. A score will then be provided so that the users can compare with friends. Creating this project as a game, rather than a purely informational website will allow the potential users to interact with the information in a way that they will find fun, but also teach them essential skills and knowledge for our day and age. To ensure a level playing field, the text will be accompanied by a voice over reading the same text that can be enabled or disabled from the start menu.
