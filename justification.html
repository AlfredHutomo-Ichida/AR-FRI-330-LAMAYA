            <h2>Workload</h2>
            <p>
                Each person is expected to be contributing to this project every week in some form. As we 
                have 6 team members, and there are varying aspects to our assignment, those being the coding of the 
                web application, the design of the web application, layout, storyline, and assignments to go alongside, 
                each team member needs to be keeping up to date with their required workload. During this unprecedented 
                time in the world, everyone will adapt to circumstances differently. This will also need to be considered, 
                that illness and personal difficulties must be respected should individuals have issues within their weekly 
                timeframe. It is essential to the production of this assignment that people speak up and ask for help 
                should they find themselves struggling with workloads or issues outside of the assignment. Our project timeline
                can be viewed in order to see the breakdown of tasks for each individual. With an accumulative combination of 240
                hours for the team, we have adequate time to get storyline, design, coding and development completed. Each of us have 
                skillsets that can assist every aspect of this assignment, and so we aim to all contribute evenly across all
                avenues of this assignment.
            </p>
               
            <h2>Beyond expected capabilities</h2>
            <p>
                Each of the team members in LAMAYA have a rudimentary understanding of various
                coding langauges. We are, as previously stated, planning to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop our
                story based game. Across the team, we have all worked with HTML and CSS, but only Alfred and Layne have used
                JavaScript before. The remaining four team members can look to Layne and Alfred to guide us through JavaScript,
                as well as self sourcing information and learning experiences from online tools such as W3Schools. In addition, 
                Megan feels comfortable designing and drawing, whereas no other team member has done any visual design before. 
                Megan can assist us with tools to design characters and interactive elements such as masks, hand sanitiser, and
                other elements of our web application that we will need. 
                
            </p>
                <h2>Risks</h2> 
                <p>
                Risk 1: Team members are not fluent in JavaScript (the language we plan to use throughout the development of 
                our web application)
                Mitigation: There are substantial tools online aimed to help individuals develop their coding knowledge. 
                Tools such as w3Schools, which breakdown certain elements of a language by providing examples and practice 
                tools will allow us to establish further knowledge and expand our skills necessary to complete this assignment. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Risk 2: Our knowledge in limiting languages may increase the timeline of certain aspects of the web application, 
                meaning we have a slippage in the predetermined schedule. 
                Mitigation: If anyone feels overwhelmed or unsure, speak to the group straight away. Being IT students, we have 
                other resources that we could use to assist in staying on time (those being peers, tutors and lecturers, online 
                tools from past classes)
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Risk 3: Design of characters and items within the application cannot be made interactive. Images can be drawn statically
                rather than made interactive.
                Mitigation: Items to be drawn are required to be created by members of this team. If we are only capable of creating
                static images, that is okay. Our extended viable products include making the characters and images interactive and
                move with the storyline into alternate backgrounds (whether they are hand drawn or photographic), but our minimum 
                viable product include characters to be static and displayed.
             
            </p>         
            
            <p>
                Risk 4: Lack of internet connection in the home prevents team members from participating in meetings and group tasks.
                Mitigiation: During the current status of the world, all team members will be studying and working from home. Internet
                connections may waver with multiple people on one connection, poor service, or many other reasons for poor internet. Should
                ones ability to be online become an issue, the team can organise to communicate via text message, or use personal hotspot
                where available to go online and submit the necessary work, or email the work completed to other team members. 
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Risk 5: Team members do not complete their allocated workload by a due date. Whether an explanation is provided or not,
                the team member does not provide their work by the deadline.
                Mitigation: If individuals do not participate to their fullest ability and submit their work when the team needs it, 
                the entire team will suffer the consequences. The benefit of working with a team is that we are able to share ideas and
                collaborate, however if team do no participate and deliver their work by the due date, the team will have to adjust the
                necessary outcomes of the project to adjust for a delay in work. This could mean failure to meet minimum viable products,
                or failure to produce a working product. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Risk 6: Team members do not attend team meetings. Along with the regular gathering once a week during the alloted 
                tutorial time, we may also create additional team meetings should we need to discuss extra work or how the 
                project is travelling. 
                Mitigation: Team meetings are vital the establishment and progression of the group project. It is vital for every
                team member to attend as many team meetings as they are able to within reason (absences due to illness or personal 
                reasons are understood). Failure to attend a team meeting means the individual loses the opportunity to voice concerns
                or ideas. However, by creating meeting minutes and uploading the recorded versions of the meetings, everyone should be
                understanding what was discussed before the next meeting. There is no reason for an individual to attend a meeting
                with no knowledge of prior communications.
