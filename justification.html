            <h3>Project Justification</h3>

            <p>
                Workload: Each person is expected to be contributing to this project every week in some form. As we 
                have 6 team members, and there are varying aspects to our assignment, those being the coding of the 
                web application, the design of the web application, layout, storyline, and assignments to go alongside, 
                each team member needs to be keeping up to date with their required workload. During this unprecedented 
                time in the world, everyone will adapt to circumstances differently. This will also need to be considered, 
                that illness and personal difficulties must be respected should individuals have issues within their weekly 
                timeframe. It is essential to the production of this assignment that people speak up and ask for help 
                should they find themselves struggling with workloads or issues outside of the assignment.
            </p>

                Beyond expected capabilities: As noted when beginning discussions occurred for this assignment, people 
                in team LAMAYA had big expectations on what they wanted to achieve from this project. The aim is to 
                create an interactive storyline game to educate children on the effects of COVID-19. Should time allow, 
                we would like to test this web application on primary school aged students, and take on the necessary 
                feedback to then adjust our assignment based on this. Adding in our own audio and dictation of the storyline 
                is also a beyond expected capability. By doing so, we would be increasing the accessibility of the web application, 
                but within the given timeframe and the minimum viable products we already decided upon, it is something we would 
                like to achieve but realistically understand if it is not feasible.

                <h2>Risk 1:</h2> 
                <i>
                    Team members are not fluent in JavaScript (the language we plan to use throughout the development of 
                    our web application)
                </i>
                <br>
                Mitigation: There are substantial tools online aimed to help individuals develop their coding knowledge. 
                Tools such as w3Schools, which breakdown certain elements of a language by providing examples and practice 
                tools will allow us to establish further knowledge and expand our skills necessary to complete this assignment. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Risk 2: Our knowledge in limiting languages may increase the timeline of certain aspects of the web application, 
                meaning we have a slippage in the predetermined schedule. 
                Mitigation: If anyone feels overwhelmed or unsure, speak to the group straight away. Being IT students, we have 
                other resources that we could use to assist in staying on time (those being peers, tutors and lecturers, online 
                tools from past classes)
