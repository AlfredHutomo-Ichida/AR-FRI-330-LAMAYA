            very good communication tool overall. This software is free
        </p>

        <h4>Text/Code Editor -> Visual Studio Code Version 1.48.0</h4>
        <p>
            Visual Code studio is a very good and feature packed widely Code Editor used by many web developers.
            We decide to use Visual Studio Code because of the features it has and it is suitable for web developing.
            There are many recommendations in the Internet that points to VSC as a great Code Editor and reliable. This software is free
        </p>

        <p>
            Github is a version control software that is used widely to keep track of versions of source code of a
            software or even data. We need to use github for to control and let all of us contribute to the HTML documents 
            and also for the final website. The version we are using is free
        </p>

        <h4>Web Design / Mockup -> Figma, Balsamiq</h4>

        <p>
            Figma is a web based software or can also be downloaded to make designs or wireframes. Figma is great tool for designing an user interface for 
            a website. Same with Figma, Balsamiq is a more basic wireframing compared to Figma which can do more. This strengten the use of Figma more 
            for our project because of the powerful function this software can be used to design a website or an app interface.

        <h4>Cloud Web Hosting -> Amazon Web Service</h4>

        <p>
            AWS is a service that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms. Their service lets us host our website so that people can 
            access our website using their own device. We are using AWS because it is provided from RMIT for us to use freely. This service 
            usually are paid but RMIT has provided us with $50 dollars credit to use.
